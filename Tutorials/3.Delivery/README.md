# Refinitiv Data Library for Python

## Summary  

These Python tutorials demonstrate how to programmatically access content residing within the **Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP)** using a single, ease of use Library called the **Refinitiv Data Library for Python**.  The platform refers to the layer of data services providing both streaming and non-streaming content serving different clients, from the simple desktop interface to the enterprise application. 

The **Refinitiv Data Library for Python** is a Refinitiv supported Library and is available on PyPi at https://pypi.org/project/refinitiv-data/

The Refinitiv Data Library for Python is structured as a stack of interfaces and libraries designed to foster the adoption of our platform by both financial coders and professional developers to programmatically access financial content.    
  
Based on this stack of interfaces, the examples defined within this section have been organized into the following folders:

### **Configuration**

The Configuration folder contains the configuration file - ***refinitiv-data.config.json*** - for the Refinitiv Data Library for Python. Before running any of the tutorials, you must modify this file depending on the access channel and connection parameters that you will use to connect to the Refinitiv Data Platform. This necessary configuration step is explained in the [Quick Start guide](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-library-for-python/quick-start)

### **Tutorials\\Delivery**

The *Delivery* tutorials target the interfaces defined within the lowest abstraction layer of the library.  The tutorials demonstrate access to content including Level 1 & 2 Streaming Data and Request/Reply data endpoints such as Instrument Pricing Analytics, News etc.

The tutorials should be used in conjunction with the **Tutorials** and **Documentation** available on the [Refinitiv Developer Portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-library-for-python)
